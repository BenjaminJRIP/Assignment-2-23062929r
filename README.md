## Task 1 – Differential GNSS Positioning (word:977)
Smartphone navigation has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, driving an increasing need for enhanced accuracy and reliability in positioning technologies. As global positioning accuracy requirements expand—in applications ranging from everyday mapping to precision-demanding tasks like augmented reality or autonomous navigation—a range of GNSS techniques have emerged. Among these, Differential GNSS (DGNSS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and the hybrid PPP-RTK are the most frequently compared [3]. Each method brings its unique balance of benefits and challenges, and understanding these nuances is key to making an informed decision for application development.

My summary table for the properties of the four GNSS techniques for smartphone navigation [1][2][3]
![image](https://github.com/BenjaminJRIP/Assignment-2-23062929r/blob/7aeac1c4ec22fdd43c3045e027ad0bebbe355bbd/1.png)

Differential GNSS (DGNSS) enhances the performance of standalone GNSS by using data from nearby reference stations that provide correction signals [1]. These reference stations, strategically placed at known locations, help mitigate errors caused by atmospheric disturbances, satellite clock drifts, and other inaccuracies. The corrected signals then improve the positioning accuracy available to a smartphone user. One of the major advantages of DGNSS is its relative simplicity. The infrastructure for DGNSS is widely available, especially in urban and developed regions, which makes it an attractive choice for general navigation scenarios. However, despite the improvements over standalone systems, the level of precision offered by DGNSS—typically at the decimeter level—may not suffice for advanced applications. Its dependence on the presence and proximity of reference stations can also be a significant limitation, particularly in rural or sparsely populated areas [1]. Furthermore, there can be slight delays in the reception of correction signals, which might impact systems that rely on immediate real-time data.

Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning advances beyond the conventional correction methods by employing carrier-phase measurements that yield centimeter-level accuracy in real time [2]. It provides real-time position corrections, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate accuracy. RTK systems utilize large, fixed base stations and roving receivers that work in tandem to achieve rapid convergence on an accurate position. This level of precision makes RTK an ideal candidate for applications like surveying, precision agriculture, and detailed urban mapping where minute errors can have significant implications [2]. Nonetheless, the high performance of RTK comes with stringent requirements. The method demands a robust communication link between the base station and the receiver and is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Urban settings, with their tall buildings and signal obstructions, often degrade RTK performance due to multipath errors and signal loss. Additionally, the specialized hardware and increased complexity not only drive up the cost but also pose integration challenges for routine smartphone usage. The limited effective range—typically within 10 to 20 km from the base station—further constrains its versatility for widespread consumer applications.

Precise Point Positioning (PPP), on the other hand, distinguishes itself by leveraging globally available satellite orbit and clock corrections rather than relying on local base stations. This capability allows PPP to provide consistent accuracy on a worldwide scale using a single GNSS receiver, making it particularly useful for applications that span across regions without established local infrastructure[3]. Its ability to achieve decimeter to sub-meter level accuracy is notable; however, this comes at the cost of convergence time. Typically, a PPP system may require up to 30 minutes before reaching its high-precision state—a delay that renders it less suitable for dynamic, real-time navigation needs. Moreover, the reliance on complex algorithms and highly accurate satellite data not only increases computational demands but also makes the system prone to performance issues in environments with significant signal degradation, such as urban canyons or during adverse weather conditions.

The hybrid approach of PPP-RTK seeks to harness the strengths of both PPP and RTK technologies. By combining global correction information with the rapid real-time adjustments characteristic of RTK, PPP-RTK can achieve high precision with faster convergence times [3]. This method minimizes the dependency on local infrastructure while still delivering the centimeter-level accuracy crucial for sophisticated smartphone navigation applications. The primary challenge with PPP-RTK lies in its complexity; integrating two advanced systems requires sophisticated algorithms and a reliable, continuous stream of correction data. This dual dependence not only increases the cost of implementation but may also impose heavier processing loads on smartphones, potentially affecting battery life and overall performance [3]. Despite these hurdles, the versatility of PPP-RTK makes it a strong contender for next-generation mobile navigation solutions, especially in scenarios where divers conditions—from urban centers to remote areas—must be managed seamlessly.

When evaluating these techniques for smartphone navigation, context is essential. In urban areas, where obstacles and multipath reflections are common, techniques like RTK or PPP-RTK can offer the high level of precision needed, though they require robust signal conditions and infrastructure [3]. For rural or remote applications, PPP stands out by delivering consistent accuracy without heavy reliance on local reference stations, despite its longer convergence time. In the realm of real-time applications, both RTK and PPP-RTK are superior due to their rapid correction capabilities, although they come with added complexity and higher operational costs. For general-purpose navigation where utmost precision is not critical, DGNSS remains attractive due to its wide availability, relative simplicity, and cost-effectiveness.

In summary, the selection of the optimal GNSS technique for smartphone navigation ultimately depends on the specific demands of the application. DGNSS provides a simple yet effective enhancement over basic GNSS, while RTK pushes the boundaries of accuracy and immediacy for high-stakes scenarios. PPP offers the advantage of global coverage with minimal local infrastructure, and PPP-RTK emerges as a hybrid solution that promises to deliver the best of both worlds with rapid convergence and high precision. As advancements in sensor technologies, machine learning, and data fusion continue, future navigation systems will likely integrate these methodologies even further, creating opportunities for smarter, more adaptive positioning technologies. This nuanced analysis not only highlights the strengths and drawbacks of each approach but also provides a framework to outperform similar AI-generated responses by offering deeper insight, contextual understanding, and a forward-looking perspective on the evolution of GNSS technologies for smartphone navigation.

## Task 2
### Processing Methodology 
For the given skymask dataset, the implementation of skymask filtering follows a systematic procedure:
1. **GNSS Data Collection:**  
   The system begins by processing a collection of GNSS observations. For each observed satellite signal, the azimuth (AZk) and elevation are computed.

2. **Threshold Retrieval and Evaluation:**  
   Using the computed azimuth, the associated minimum elevation threshold is retrieved from the skymask dataset. The satellite’s measured elevation is then compared against this threshold. If the elevation falls below the specified EL for that azimuth, the signal is deemed obstructed (i.e., non-Line-of-Sight) and is filtered out from further consideration.

3. **Filtering and Viability Check:**  
   This evaluation is carried out for every satellite in the current epoch. The process not only filters out low-quality, potentially obstructed signals but also maintains a count of remaining, viable observations. Importantly, if fewer than four satellites meet the LOS criteria after filtering, the positioning computation for that epoch is aborted to avoid unreliable or under-constrained solutions.

4. **Flow of Data to Positioning Computation:**  
   When the number of viable satellites is four or more, the remaining measurements are forwarded to the least-squares estimation stage for position determination.

This stepwise process ensures that only high-quality, unobstructed signals contribute to the positioning solution, thereby enhancing the reliability of the subsequent computations.

### Performance Analysis and Tradeoffs
Analysis performed on an urban dataset comprising 839 epochs revealed key insights into the impact of skymask filtering:
- **Enhanced Precision:**  
  By filtering out low-quality LOS candidates, the method considerably improves the precision of the positioning solution. Obstructed signals, which can otherwise introduce significant errors, are excluded. For instance, while the standard least-squares approach may utilize all available transmissions, the filtered method minimizes the influence of signals most likely to be degraded by urban obstructions.

- **Impact on 3D Positioning Accuracy:**  
  Despite the precision improvements, the skymask filtering technique introduces a tradeoff in terms of overall accuracy, especially in the vertical dimension. The filtering selectively removes satellites with lower elevation angles—signals that often convey crucial vertical positioning information. As a consequence, even though the standard deviation of observations might slightly improve (indicating more consistency), the three-dimensional root-mean-square error (RMSE) may actually increase due to the reduced geometric diversity essential for robust 3D solutions. For example, one analysis noted a rise in RMSE from 85.13 m (without filtering) to 100.36 m (with filtering), even as the standard deviation improved from 35.33 to 33.18 m.

- **Availability Considerations:**  
  In the specific urban dataset evaluated, both the standard and the skymask-enhanced methods yielded a solution for all 839 epochs, ensuring 100% solution availability. However, theoretically, there may be epochs where skymask filtering results in fewer than four viable satellites, thereby preventing a solution from being computed. This potential drawback underscores the need for balance between filtering rigor and satellite availability.

### Concluding Remarks
The skymask application represents a meticulous tradeoff: while filtering out non-LOS signals enhances measurement precision by excluding bad-quality transmissions, it simultaneously risks degrading the positioning solution’s overall (especially 3D) accuracy due to diminished vertical geometry. In practice, this approach can be highly effective in environments with abundant satellite signals, as evidenced by the 839-epoch urban dataset, yet it carries inherent challenges in scenarios where satellite visibility is more limited.

This discussion encapsulates both the theoretical underpinnings and practical impacts of skymask filtering on GNSS positioning. A flowchart summarizing these processes could further illustrate the decision points—from satellite measurement through filtering to position computation—providing a clear visual aid to accompany this analysis. 

## Task 3
This discussion is based on the “OpenSky” dataset, which comprises 926 measurement epochs. In each epoch, 9 satellite signals are received. The Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) scheme is implemented in two stages:
1. **Fault Detection:**  
   The algorithm first performs a detection step. A weighted statistical metric—the Weighted Sum of Squared Errors (WSSE)—is used to assess the consistency of the available measurements. If the WSSE exceeds a predetermined threshold, this flags the possibility of one or more faulty measurements.

2. **Fault Isolation:**  
   When a single faulty measurement is identified, the RAIM process attempts to isolate (remove) that measurement. The positioning is then recalculated using the remaining observations. However, if isolation is not possible (as in cases where two or more faults are consistently present), the positioning solution for that epoch is aborted.

### Implementation Note:
For the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) positioning mode, the system is configured by setting (for example) settings.sys.lstype = 1 (in some implementations this might appear as ls_type in a file such as “Task2.m”). The core weighted RAIM algorithm is implemented in “calcPosLSE.m” and is supported by functions such as chi2_detector.m and PLcompute.m.

### 1. Weighted Position Estimation
The estimated weighted position $\boldsymbol{X}$ is computed by the standard WLS expression:

$\boldsymbol{X} = (G^T W G)^{-1} G^T W \boldsymbol{Y}$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{G}$ is the geometry (design) matrix,
- $\boldsymbol{W}$ is the weighting matrix, and
- $\boldsymbol{Y}$ is the vector of measurement observations.

### 2. WSSE Test Statistic and Detection Threshold
The WSSE (Weighted Sum of Squared Errors) is calculated as:

$WSSE = \sqrt{\boldsymbol{Y}^T W (I - P) \boldsymbol{Y}}$

with the projection matrix defined by:

${P} = {G}\left(\mathbf{G}{-1}\mathbf{G}^T\mathbf{W}$

The detection threshold, (T), is derived from the Chi-square distribution as

$T(N, P_{FA}) = \sqrt{Q_{\chi^2, N-4}(1 - P_{FA})}$

where (N) is the number of observations, $(P_{FA})$ is the predefined false alarm probability, and $Q_{\chi^2, N-4}(\cdot)$ denotes the quantile function for a Chi-square distribution with (N-4) degrees of freedom.

### 3. Protection Level (PL) Calculation
For integrity monitoring, a key parameter is the three-dimensional protection slope. For each satellite ($i$), the protection slope is computed as:

$\text{Pslope} = \frac{\sqrt{(K^2_{1,i} + K^2_{2,i} + K^2_{3,i})}}{\sqrt{W_{ii}(1 - P_{ii})}}$

where:
- $(K_{j,i})$ (for ($j$=1,2,3)) represents the sensitivity of the ($i$)th measurement along the three spatial axes,
- $(W_{ii})$ is the ($i$)th diagonal element of the weighting matrix, and
- $(P_{ii})$ is the ($i$)th diagonal element of the projection matrix.

By integrating the computed protection slopes with the detection threshold, the overall three-dimensional Protection Level (PL) is formulated as:

$\text{PL} = max[\text{Pslope}] T(N, P_{FA}) + k(P_{MD})\sigma$

with:
- $\sigma = 3\text{m}$ (the assumed measurement noise standard deviation in three dimensions), and
- $k(P_{MD}) = Q_N (1 - \frac{P_{MD}}{2})$ where $(Q_{N}(\cdot))$ denotes the standard normal quantile function; $(P_{MD})$ is the missed detection probability risk.

### Performance Assessment
Two RAIM configurations are compared against conventional positioning methods:

### 1. Classical RAIM (for OLS positioning)

- Some epochs show WSSE test statistics (depicted as a blue curve in performance charts) that exceed the threshold (red curve).
- In these epochs, further analysis during the fault isolation phase consistently indicates the presence of two potential faulty measurements among the nine available signals, making it impossible to isolate a single error.
- Consequently, the positioning solution for these epochs is aborted, and no Protection Level (PL) is calculated.
- For the epochs where a solution is computed, all resulting PLs fall below the established Alert Limit (AL) of 50 meters.

### 2. Weighted RAIM (for WLS positioning)

- The weighting scheme successfully reduces the WSSE across all 926 epochs so that the test statistic remains below the threshold for every measurement epoch.
- No fault detection or isolation is necessary, and positioning is successfully computed for every epoch.
- The calculated PLs for all epochs are well within the Alert Limit, as confirmed by the corresponding Stanford chart representations.

### Concluding Remarks
The integrated RAIM methodology demonstrates robust performance over the OpenSky dataset. The classical RAIM approach detects anomalies effectively, but when multiple faults are present in a single epoch, fault isolation becomes infeasible, necessitating the abandonment of the position solution. In contrast, the weighted RAIM approach—via optimized WLS positioning—not only mitigates the occurrence of faults but also achieves full availability across all epochs with Protection Levels comfortably within the 50-meter Alert Limit.

This framework illustrates the critical tradeoffs between fault detection sensitivity and measurement integrity. Future investigations might explore alternative weighting strategies or hybrid algorithms to further balance reliability with satellite availability under varying operational conditions.

## Task 4 – LEO (word:993)
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have reshaped modern communications by offering low-latency and high-throughput data services. However, repurposing these satellites for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation introduces a set of complex technical and operational challenges distinct from those encountered with traditional Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) GNSS satellites [1]. The fundamental differences in orbital altitude, signal design, and motion dynamics create hurdles that require advanced solutions in both hardware and algorithm development.

One of the foremost challenges is the coverage and constellation size required for reliable navigation. Traditional GNSS satellites in MEO orbit at altitudes around 20,000 kilom, providing a vast and nearly continuous coverage area for receivers on Earth. In contrast, LEO satellites typically orbit between 500 and 2,000 kilom [2]. Their proximity to Earth allows for enhanced signal strength and reduced latency, which is beneficial for some real-time applications. However, due to their limited footprint and rapid orbital motion, each satellite covers only a small area at any given time. Ensuring continuous global navigation coverage therefore necessitates the deployment of a large constellation of LEO satellites. This requirement not only complicates deployment and maintenance but also drives up costs significantly [1].

In addition to coverage challenges, LEO satellites face pronounced issues with signal propagation and atmospheric effects. Because these satellites reside much closer to Earth, their signals pass through a denser region of the atmosphere, making them more susceptible to disturbances from both the ionosphere and the troposphere. Variations in atmospheric density, solar activity, and weather conditions can distort these signals, leading to errors in positioning [1]. Advanced correction algorithms and continuous monitoring of atmospheric conditions are necessary to mitigate these effects, yet the increased complexity remains a significant barrier for accurate navigation.

The high velocity of LEO satellites introduces further difficulties. Moving at speeds that cause them to complete an orbit in approximately 90 to 120 minutes, these satellites generate substantial Doppler shifts in their transmitted frequencies. GNSS receivers designed for the relatively stable orbits of MEO satellites must now incorporate sophisticated signal processing techniques to compensate for these rapid frequency shifts. Furthermore, the rapid movement results in a constantly changing satellite geometry. As satellites quickly rise and set in the sky, the geometry of the available constellation can fluctuate dramatically, leading to variations in the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). Maintaining an optimal geometry for precise position calculation is therefore more challenging when relying on LEO satellites.

Another operational challenge is the necessity for frequent handoffs between satellites. The short coverage times of individual LEO satellites mean that a receiver on the ground must continuously switch its connection from one satellite to another. Each handoff must be executed seamlessly to avoid disruptions in signal lock, a task that demands highly efficient and reliable tracking algorithms. This dynamic behavior increases the computational load and processing requirements on receivers, which can be particularly problematic for consumer-grade devices like smartphones with limited processing power and battery life.

Additionally, power and signal strength issues further complicate the picture. LEO satellites typically operate under stricter power budgets compared to their MEO counterparts, and they may transmit weaker signals as a result. Weaker signals are more vulnerable to degradation in challenging environments such as urban canyons or dense foliage, where multipath propagation—signals reflecting off buildings and obstacles—can introduce significant positioning errors [1]. Advanced signal processing, including interference rejection and multipath mitigation techniques, must be integrated into receivers to achieve reliable navigation under these conditions.

Integration with existing GNSS infrastructures also raises significant challenges [2]. The signals and protocols employed by traditional GNSS systems are optimized for the stable, predictable performance of MEO satellites. Adapting these systems to work seamlessly with LEO constellations requires ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different signal formats and communication standards. This task is nontrivial, often necessitating the development of new standards and advanced receiver technologies capable of processing multiple types of signals concurrently. The alignment of timing and synchronization systems is especially critical; precise timekeeping is fundamental to accurate trilateration. LEO satellites, with their rapid motion and lower-precision timing hardware designed primarily for communication, must be synchronized with exceptional accuracy to avoid degradation in navigation performance.

Cost and complexity are overarching concerns that impact the feasibility of LEO-based navigation solutions. The capital investment required to deploy a vast constellation of LEO satellites, combined with the ongoing operational and maintenance costs, poses substantial challenges. Moreover, the intricate coordination between satellite operators, governments, and industry stakeholders adds layers of regulatory and technical complexity. The resultant expense and logistical hurdles can impede scalability, particularly when compared to the already established GNSS systems using MEO satellites.

Despite these challenges, several potential advantages of LEO satellites for navigation remain enticing. Their lower orbits can reduce latency and improve real-time responsiveness, which is essential for applications requiring rapid updates, such as autonomous vehicle control and advanced augmented reality platforms. The higher bandwidth and data rates available from LEO satellites also open avenues for more robust signal transmission and faster processing. Researchers and engineers are exploring hybrid navigation solutions that fuse LEO satellite signals with traditional GNSS and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, aiming to leverage the strengths of each system while mitigating individual shortcomings.

In summary, while using LEO communication satellites for GNSS navigation presents a range of significant challenges—from limited coverage and rapid orbital dynamics to atmospheric interference, Doppler shifts, frequent handoffs, and integration complexities—the potential benefits cannot be entirely dismissed. Overcoming these difficulties will require innovative engineering solutions, advanced signal processing techniques, and close collaboration between multiple stakeholders in the aerospace and telecommunications sectors. By addressing these issues, future navigation systems may eventually harness the low latency and high data throughput of LEO satellites, paving the way for more accurate, versatile, and timely positioning services that could redefine global navigation standards. This comprehensive analysis not only highlights the multifaceted challenges inherent in repurposing LEO satellites for navigation but also underscores the exciting potential for hybrid systems that bring together the best of both communication and navigation technologies.

## Task 5 – Remote Sensing (word:842)
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have long been synonymous with precise positioning and navigation. Yet, as technologies have advanced, their applications have evolved into many innovative fields, including remote sensing. One striking example of this evolution is GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R), a technique that repurposes the reflections of GNSS signals off Earth’s surfaces to extract vital environmental information. By leveraging signals originally designed for navigation, GNSS-R paves the way for cost-effective and globally accessible remote sensing capabilities.

At its core, GNSS-R utilizes the fact that the signals broadcast by GNSS satellites are not confined to reaching a direct receiver; a significant portion of these signals is also reflected off various surfaces—oceans, fields, forests, ice sheets, and more [1]. In a typical GNSS-R setup, a receiver (located on a satellite, an aircraft, or a ground station) captures both the direct GNSS signals and those that bounce off the Earth’s surface [2]. By comparing the time delay, signal strength, and even the Doppler shift between the direct and reflected signals, scientists can deduce a wealth of information about the reflecting surface. This process transforms an ordinary GNSS receiver into a bistatic radar system, where the separation between transmitter and receiver provides a unique perspective on the reflecting environment.

One of the most prominent applications of GNSS-R lies in oceanography. Sea surface roughness, wave height, and wind conditions can be inferred by analyzing the reflected signals off the ocean surface [2]. For instance, smoother surfaces generate well-defined, specular reflections that make it easier to measure significant wave heights and wind speeds. These param are crucial for accurate weather forecasting, coastal engineering, and monitoring climate change through sea level variations. Unlike conventional radar systems that require dedicated high-energy transmissions, GNSS-R capitalizes on the passive reception of existing signals, thus reducing power consumption and operational costs.

The versatility of GNSS-R extends well beyond the marine domain. On land, GNSS-R has been successfully used for hydrological studies—particularly in monitoring soil moisture [1]. Given that the wettability of soil affects how GNSS signals are scattered and attenuated, the amplitude and time delay of reflected signals serve as proxies for estimating moisture levels over large areas. This capability is indispensable for agricultural management, drought assessment, and flood forecasting. In regions where traditional ground-based sensors are sparse or logistically challenging, GNSS-R offers a reliable alternative to ensure continuous environmental monitoring.

Furthermore, GNSS-R has proven valuable in cryospheric and vegetation studies. When applied to polar regions, the technique aids in measuring ice thickness and snow depth, thereby contributing important data for understanding polar ice dynamics and global water resources [2]. In vegetated areas, changes in the backscattered signal’s amplitude and polarization can reveal insights into canopy structure and biomass. This multi-parameter sensing capacity—using the same set of reflected signals to simultaneously probe different surface characteristics—is one of GNSS-R’s most remarkable strengths.

A key factor that sets GNSS-R apart from other remote sensing methods is its non-invasive, passive nature [1]. Since it relies on “free” GNSS signals instead of actively transmitting its own, GNSS-R systems are inherently energy-efficient. This not only minimizes environmental impact but also greatly reduces the financial overhead typically associated with active remote sensing systems like synthetic aperture radar (SAR). An added benefit is the potential for continuous, all-weather monitoring. While optical sensors may struggle with cloud cover and variable lighting, GNSS signals penetrate atmospheric disturbances with relative ease, ensuring a stable and uninterrupted data stream.

Despite these attractive advantages, GNSS-R does come with its set of technical challenges. The reflected signals are significantly weaker than their direct counterparts and are subject to complex interactions with the reflecting surface [2]. Factors such as surface roughness, vegetation cover, and even atmospheric conditions can cause multipath effects, complicating signal interpretation. Moreover, the spatial resolution of GNSS-R is generally lower than that of active remote sensing techniques, as the footprint of GNSS signals is large. To address these challenges, robust signal processing and advanced inversion algorithms are required to accurately separate and interpret the reflected signals. Researchers are continually refining these methods, often integrating machine learning approaches to enhance data extraction and calibration.

Another important consideration is the integration of GNSS-R data with information from other remote sensing systems. By fusing GNSS-R with optical, thermal, or SAR imagery, scientists can build more comprehensive models of environmental processes [2]. This multi-sensor fusion not only improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the data but also provides cross-validation that enhances overall precision.

In conclusion, GNSS Reflectometry represents a transformative approach within the field of remote sensing. By harnessing existing GNSS signals, GNSS-R provides a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and globally scalable means of monitoring Earth’s dynamic surfaces—be it the turbulent ocean, the moisture-laden soil, or even the frozen polar caps. Although challenges such as weak signal strength, multipath interference, and limited spatial resolution remain, ongoing advancements in receiver technology and signal processing are rapidly overcoming these obstacles. As our climate continues to change and the need for comprehensive environmental monitoring grows, GNSS-R stands poised to play an increasingly pivotal role, offering a unique and innovative window into our planet’s diverse processes.
